# Simple Banking App

Welcome to the Simple Banking App! This application is a basic Banking App where we tested/demonstrated our CI/CD pipeline.

## Overview

This project consists of three versions of the banking app, each progressively improving upon the last:

- **Version 1**: Very basic version with hard-coded user credentials.
- **Version 2**: Separate database file. 
- **Version 3**: Same as Version 2 but as a Flask app. 

## CI/CD Pipeline

The pipeline includes:

1. **Testing**: Automated tests on GitHub Actions using Pytest. 
2. **Building and Pushing Docker Images**: The application is containerized and deployed to Docker Hub.
